shiny_locks
===========

shiny_locks is an implementation of file locks using Python's with statement. It's a hassle free way to run your scripts, one script at a time. The code is directly from [Amir Salihfendic's blog posting.](http://amix.dk/blog/post/19531)

I needed it for some of my projects. Please look at Amir's site. You may also want to review the following lock implementations:
